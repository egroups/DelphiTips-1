# DelphiTips
Useful Delphi Units which provide full functionality in a single PAS file.

## DUnitm - Mini Test Framework
The [Mini Test framework](https://github.com/glenkleidon/DelphiTips/wiki/Mini-Test-Framework) is a light-weight unit testing framework which simply requires that you
include the single MiniTestFrameWork.pas in a console app, and start testing your code.

### Added Features: 
  + Test Run support
  + Set level Skipping
  + Set level Expected Exceptions
  + Project Templates
  
See the updated wiki!

### Updated Support
Now Supports All versions of Delphi back to Delphi 7 (and probably 4).  This has been tested on:

|Version  |Version     |Version    |Version    |Version     |       |
|---------|-----------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----------:|:------|
|4 &#9744;|2005 &#9744;|XE  &#9745;|XE6 &#9744;|10.0 Seattle|&#9744;|
|5 &#9744;|2006 &#9744;|XE2 &#9745;|XE7 &#9744;|10.1 Berlin |&#9745;|
|6 &#9744;|2007 &#9745;|XE3 &#9744;|XE8 &#9744;|10.2 Tokyo  |&#9744;|
|7 &#9745;|2009 &#9745;|XE4 &#9744;|           |            |       |
|8 &#9744;|2010 &#9745;|XE5 &#9745;|           |            |       |

If using versions of Delphi 2005 or 2006, You may have trouble with the 
2007 DPROJ file in the Test Unit and the Project Template folders.  If you 
do have trouble, simply remove the DPROJ file and get Delphi to rebuild from the
DPR file.

## Delphi Record Types Utils (RecordUtils.pas) - Generic Support for JSON, URL Encoding and Value pairs.  

Pascal Records are extremely useful in general in Pascal.  Because they are automatically memory managed in Delphi, they are very easy to work with, work well with the Parallel Task Library and tend to be better for Function programming styles. However, they have limitations because they are not classes, they are more difficult to automatically populate from Streamed Data without using published properties.

This project started as a way to manage REST Services in a way closest to the way it is done in JavaScript/NodeJS.  Simply declare the object and then use it with the response.

## What does the Record Utils Unit accomplish?
   1. Safe shallow COPY (_*clone*_) any record to another record of the same type ensuring reference counting is preserved
   2. Automatically CLEAR any declared Record.
   3. Cast between TEXT (Value Pairs, URL Encoding, or JSON ) and Record.
   4. Automatically generate a Web Post from a Record and apply a Web Response to vanilla Pascal record in 1 line of code.

Because you are using records, you do not need to manage the memory, so coding becomes much simpler and more readable.

## Tasks
_*RecordUtils.pas*_ uses RTTI to automatically serialise and deserialse records as Text.  This allows you to:
   1. Automatically store a record INI file and then *IMPLICITLY* populate the record  _*from*_ an INI File.
   2. Assign all the properties to a record OR Record Array from a string
   3. Create simple records in a Server Application and pass them to client application without using Client Data Sets or OLEVariants. (Great for DataSnap or Web Service Applications)
   4. One of the most useful benefits is to consume REST service and automatically populate the response into an array of Records with no code.

 eg
```
TMyRecordStatus = (mrsNone, mrsBusy, mrsIdle); 
TMyRecord=Record
  id : integer;
  Name: string;
  isNew : boolean;
  Status : TMyRecordStatus; // enum
end;
```
To Store this as an

WIll be serialised as 
```
id=1
Name=Test1
isNew=True
Status=mrsBusy
```
### Supported Types
Currently only the Data types Integer, String, Boolean and any Enumerated type are supported. _NESTED Records_ are not supported at this time. 

### Support for Arrays
Yes, arrays are supported.  The Above example as an array would be output as:
```
id[0]=1
Name[0]=Test1
isNew[0]=True
Status[0]=mrsBusy

id[1]=2
Name[1]=Test2
isNew[1]=false
Status[1]=mrsNone
```
The Data Type and Array count can optionally be included in the data in the following way:

_Single Record_
```
RecordType=TMyRecord
```
_Array of Records_
```
RecordType=TMyRecord[]
RecordCount=2
```
The alternative format where each id is prefixed with the data type is also supported for Parsing (but will not be output in this format). Eg

_Single Record_
```
TMyRecord.id=1
TMyRecord.Name=Test1
TMyRecord.isNew=True
TMyRecord.Status=mrsBusy
```
_Array of Records_
```
TMyRecord[0].id=1
TMyRecord[0].Name=Test1
TMyRecord[0].isNew=True
TMyRecord[0].Status=mrsBusy

TMyRecord[1].id=1
TMyRecord[1].Name=Test1
TMyRecord[1].isNew=True
TMyRecord[1].Status=mrsBusy
```


### Line Endings
Internally the string structure is managed as a TStringlist, so the line ending symantics are a consequence of that architecture.   

The \<CR\> (Carriage Return, ASCII-13) cannot be represented as a single line in the TStringlist (by default) and consequently are always converted to \<LF\> (Line Feed, ASCII-10).  So \<CRLF\> becomes \<LF\>, \<CR\> becomes \<LF\>, \<CRLF\>\<LF\> becomes \<LF\>\<LF\>.  At this stage, to preserve \<CR\>, you must pre-process the string representation using an alternate encoding scheme (eg HTML encoding )
